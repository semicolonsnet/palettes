# palettes
A collection of my standard color palettes and related resources. I am not a color designer, just a guy who pretends with his iPhone sometimes.


## The Palettes

- Rust Dreams: Designed for use with UIs in dark mode with several shade variants, built around a dark orange / rust color
- Calm Orange: Built around a mid-tone orange with complimentary blue and choice of grays
- Cascadia: A tetrad-based scheme with four text colors that meet [WCAG AAA guidelines](http://colorsafe.co) on a #ffffff background.
